# Moore bounds: fresh neighbours and the shared counting core

The parts of the Moore argument that do not mention a layer family: the fresh
neighbours of a path's tail, the short cycle a chord would create, and the two
lemmas (`pred_le_ncard_freshNeighborSet`, `false_of_two_paths_of_common_fresh_neighbor`)
that the odd and even layer families both consume.

Part of the `MooreBound` folder; see the umbrella module
`GraphLib.Theory.Structures.SimpleGraph_only.MooreBound`.

/-! ## Degree helpers

TEMPORARY: these three lemmas are pure `neighborSet` / `degree` API with no
dependence on the Moore development. They logically belong in
`GraphLib/Graph/Degree.lean` (alongside the `neighborSet` / `degree` definitions
they use, which are themselves temporarily housed in
`GraphLib.Theory.Structures.SimpleGraph_only.Girth`; see the section note there).
They live here at the top of the file only so that the Moore proofs below can use
them while `Degree.lean` is being developed by a collaborator. Do not treat this
placement as a precedent: no further degree API should be added here, and these
should move to `Graph/Degree.lean` once it is ready. -/

/-! ## Shared core of the two layer-growth lemmas

`mul_ncard_rootLayer_le_succ_of_lt_girth` (`RootedLayers.lean`) and
`mul_ncard_halfLayer_le_succ_of_lt_girth` (`HalfLayers.lean`) prove the same
statement for two different layer families (rooted paths, and rooted paths
avoiding the far end of a central edge). The lemmas here are exactly the parts of
that argument which do not mention the layer family at all, so both callers share
them:

* `Set.mul_ncard_le_ncard_of_children` (in `Counting.lean`) — the counting
  skeleton;
* `pred_le_ncard_freshNeighborSet` — the per-vertex lower bound;
* `false_of_two_paths_of_common_fresh_neighbor` — the disjointness core. -/

two distinct paths with the same endpoints, hence a cycle of length at most `2 * (n + 1)`,
contradicting the girth bound. -/
