# Bipartite simple graphs

A simple graph is *bipartite* when it admits a proper two-colouring: a colouring
of the vertices by `Bool` under which every edge joins vertices of opposite
colour. Along a realized vertex sequence the colour therefore flips across each
edge, so the two endpoints agree in colour exactly when the sequence has even
length. Specialising this to closed walks — in particular simple cycles — shows
that every cycle in a bipartite graph is even.

The girth consequence (`SimpleGraph.girth.even_of_isBipartite`) lives in
`GraphLib.Theory.Structures.SimpleGraph_only.Girth`, so that the basic colouring
definitions here do not depend on the girth development.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleGraph.IsProperTwoColoring G color` — `color` is a proper two-colouring.
* `SimpleGraph.IsBipartite G` — `G` admits a proper two-colouring.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.IsBipartite.even_length_of_closed` — a realized closed walk in a
  bipartite graph has even length.
* `SimpleGraph.IsBipartite.even_length_of_isSimpleCycleIn` — every realized simple
  cycle in a bipartite graph has even length.

## Implementation notes

The colouring formulation is chosen because the parity argument reduces to a
single `Bool` flip along each edge, avoiding any set-partition bookkeeping. The
workhorse is `IsProperTwoColoring.same_color_iff_even`, an `iff` proved by
induction on `IsVertexSeqIn`; the closed-walk and cycle statements are short
corollaries of it, and live in the `IsBipartite` namespace because that is the
predicate they assume.
