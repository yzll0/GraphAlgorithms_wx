# Subgraphs and induced subgraphs

This file equips each of the four graph structures from
`GraphLib.Graph.Basic` (`Graph`, `SimpleGraph`, `DiGraph`, `SimpleDiGraph`)
with a subgraph predicate and an induced-subgraph constructor.

## Main definitions

* `Graph.subgraphOf`, `SimpleGraph.subgraphOf`, `DiGraph.subgraphOf`,
  `SimpleDiGraph.subgraphOf` — `H` is a subgraph of `G` when its vertex
  set and edge set are both contained in those of `G`.
* `Graph.induce`, `SimpleGraph.induce`, `DiGraph.induce`,
  `SimpleDiGraph.induce` — the subgraph induced by a vertex set `S`,
  obtained by keeping only the vertices of `G` that lie in `S` and the
  edges of `G` whose endpoints all lie in `S`.

## Notation

* `G[S]`: the subgraph of `G` induced by `S`, provided by `GetElem`
  instances on each of the four graph structures.

## Design choices

* **One predicate per graph type.** We give `subgraphOf` a separate
  definition for each of the four graph structures rather than
  factoring through a `HasSubgraph` typeclass. This keeps the
  definitions concrete and avoids introducing typeclass machinery
  before downstream files have any use for it.
* **Compare structure fields, not projections.** For the labelled types
  `Graph` and `DiGraph`, we compare the underlying `edgeSet : Set (Edge α β)`
  / `Set (Arc α β)` rather than the `E(G)` projection to `Sym2 α`
  / `α × α`. Two parallel edges with different labels are distinct in
  the labelled world, and `subgraphOf` should respect that.
* **Induced on a `Set`, intersected with `V(G)`.** Vertex sets are
  `Set α`, and the induced subgraph takes a set `S : Set α` and uses
  `S ∩ V(G)` as the new vertex set. This makes `induce` well-behaved
  even when `S` mentions vertices outside `V(G)` and ensures the
  result is always literally a subgraph of `G`.
* **No looseness lemma is needed.** The induced edge set is carved from
  `G.edgeSet`, so `loopless'` (when present) is inherited verbatim from
  `G`; no separate looplessness obligation appears.
